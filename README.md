# Platformer-Game
To run this project first go to eclipse then use import to clone this project from git.
Once this has been completed, make sure to download the images in the bin folder and place them in the eclipse project's bin folder.
On the university vdi I recieved an error, to fix it go to the properties of the java project, go to java build path, libraries, select access rules, edit, add, set resolution to accessible and set javafx/** as the rule pattern. There might be a better solution but this got it running on the university computer for me.
From here the game should run!
